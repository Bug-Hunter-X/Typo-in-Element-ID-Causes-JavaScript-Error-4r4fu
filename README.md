This repository demonstrates a subtle yet common error in HTML: a typo in an element's ID attribute when using JavaScript to manipulate the DOM. The bug.html file contains the erroneous code, while bugSolution.html provides the corrected version.  The bug arises when the JavaScript code attempts to access an element using getElementById() with a misspelled ID.  This results in the JavaScript code failing silently or throwing an error, depending on the browser's error handling.  The solution involves carefully checking the element's ID for typos and ensuring that the ID used in the JavaScript code exactly matches the ID in the HTML.
